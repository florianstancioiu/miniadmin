# MiniCMS

A Laravel based project by Florian Stancioiu

The goal of the project is to have a small content management system into place that I can use for my personal projects. The CMS uses [AdminLTE](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE) and [Clean Blog](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog) as templates for the admin side and client side.

__The project is in its early stages, expect errors and missing features.__
